## Releases:

![](docs/releaseExplanation2.png)

At each development phase we will create a release. **What is a release?** A release is simply a neatly packaged **executable form** of the project. In this case, a release will be comprised of a few files - specifically Andriod APK, iOS IPA and WebApp files. These files will represent the project in it's complete form at a given point in the development phase (i.e. alpha, beta, stable, experimental etc.). Read more about releases in the **Version Branches** section of Workflow Rules below.
